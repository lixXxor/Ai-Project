Cozy-Ai-Project-AIAIAI
======================

Cozy AI project made by Linköping University students Martin Stengård,  Mikael Pettersson and Gustav Zaphf.

This project is made out of a kind of natural selection in a fish habitat. New fish spawn every certain amount of seconds with traits from the best fish out of the previous generation. A risk of mutation is set so that the fish can evolve naturally. 

A day-night time cycle spawns predators that can eat the fish, which improves the rate of mutated fish.
